    <h1>create a JavaScript function that simulates an asynchronous loop. Asynchronous loops are essential when dealing with tasks that involve asynchronous operations like API calls, file I/O, or database operations. By using asynchronous loops, we can iterate over a collection of items and perform asynchronous tasks on each item without blocking the main thread.</h1>
